# `<SignedOut />`

The `SignedOut` component conditionally renders its children only when the user is not authenticated with Asgardeo.
It checks the current authentication state and displays content for unauthenticated users, while rendering optional `fallback` content (or nothing by default) when the user is authenticated.
This makes it ideal for showing sign-in prompts, public landing pages, or content that should only be visible to guests.

## Usage

You can use the `SignedOut` component to wrap any content that should only be visible to unauthenticated users.

### Basic Usage

Use `SignedOut` to show content only when not signed in.

```jsx title="src/App.jsx" showLineNumbers
import { SignedOut, SignInButton } from '@asgardeo/react'

function App() {
  return (
    <SignedOut>
      <div>
        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <SignInButton />
      </div>
    </SignedOut>
  )
}

export default App
```

:::note
If the user is signed in, nothing will be rendered unless you provide a `fallback` prop.
:::

### With Fallback

Show alternative content when the user is signed in:

```jsx title="src/App.jsx" showLineNumbers
import { SignedOut } from '@asgardeo/react'

function App() {
  return (
    <SignedOut fallback={<p>You are already signed in</p>}>
      <div>
        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>Please sign in to continue</p>
      </div>
    </SignedOut>
  )
}

export default App
```
