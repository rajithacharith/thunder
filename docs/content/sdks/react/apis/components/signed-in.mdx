# `<SignedIn />`

The `SignedIn` component conditionally renders its children only when the user is authenticated with Asgardeo.
It checks the current authentication state and displays protected UI content for signed-in users, while rendering optional `fallback` content (or nothing by default) when the user is not authenticated.
This makes it ideal for guarding routes or UI sections that require authentication.

## Usage

You can use the `SignedIn` component to wrap any content that should only be visible to authenticated users.

### Basic Usage

Use `SignedIn` to show content only when signed in.

```jsx title="src/App.jsx" showLineNumbers
import { SignedIn } from '@asgardeo/react'

function App() {
  return (
    <SignedIn>
      <p>Welcome! You are signed in.</p>
    </SignedIn>
  )
}

export default App
```

:::note
If the user is not signed in, nothing will be rendered unless you provide a `fallback` prop.
:::

### With Fallback

Show alternative content when the user is not signed in:

```jsx title="src/App.jsx" showLineNumbers
import { SignedIn } from '@asgardeo/react'

function App() {
  return (
    <SignedIn fallback={<p>Please sign in to continue</p>}>
      <p>Welcome! You are signed in.</p>
    </SignedIn>
  )
}

export default App
```
