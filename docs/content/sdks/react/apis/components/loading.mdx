# `<Loading />`

The `Loading` component renders its children while the authentication state is being determined.
It checks the current authentication state and displays a loading indicator or custom content during the initial authentication check, while rendering optional `fallback` content (or nothing by default) once authentication is complete.
This makes it ideal for providing user feedback during the initial app load or authentication verification.

## Usage

You can use the `Loading` component to wrap any content that should be visible during authentication state checks.

### Basic Usage

Use `Loading` to show content while authentication is being verified.

```jsx title="src/App.jsx" showLineNumbers
import { Loading } from '@asgardeo/react'

function App() {
  return (
    <Loading>
      <div>Checking authentication...</div>
    </Loading>
  )
}

export default App
```

:::note
Once the authentication state is determined, nothing will be rendered unless you provide a `fallback` prop.
:::

### With Fallback

Show your main application content once loading is complete:

```jsx title="src/App.jsx" showLineNumbers
import { Loading, SignedIn, SignedOut } from '@asgardeo/react'

function App() {
  return (
    <Loading
      fallback={
        <>
          <SignedIn>
            <Dashboard />
          </SignedIn>
          <SignedOut>
            <LandingPage />
          </SignedOut>
        </>
      }
    >
      <div>Checking authentication...</div>
    </Loading>
  )
}

export default App
```
