# Thunder Documentation Style Guide

This style guide defines the writing and formatting standards for Thunder documentation. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, clarity, and a high-quality experience for all readers.

All contributors must review and follow these standards when creating or updating documentation.

---

## Audience

Thunder documentation serves:

- Identity developers
- Application developers
- System administrators
- IT professionals

When writing documentation, explicitly identify who the content is for and adjust the depth and terminology accordingly.

### Targeting a Specific Audience

- Use terminology familiar to that role.
- Do not over-explain concepts they are expected to know.
- Focus on tasks and responsibilities relevant to that role.

For example:

- For identity developers, you may assume familiarity with OAuth flows, tokens, and claims.
- For system administrators, you may assume familiarity with configuration files and deployment environments.

### Writing for a General Audience

- Assume basic IT knowledge.
- Do not assume deep familiarity with identity protocols or Thunder internals.
- Define Thunder-specific concepts on first use.
- Focus on clarity over technical density.

---

## Writing Standards

### Voice and Tone

- Use **active voice** and **present tense**. The only exception is when the actor is unknown or unimportant, in which case passive voice can be used.
- Address the reader as "you."
- Maintain a professional, friendly, and neutral tone.
- Avoid slang, jokes, sarcasm, and marketing language.
- Avoid weasel words and vague language. Be specific and direct. For example, instead of "may," use "can" or "allows." Instead of "some", specify the exact number or percentage.
- Avoid wordy phrases. Use concise language. For example, instead of "in order to," use "to". Instead of "due to the fact that" use "because".

### Terminology and Consistency

Consistency in terminology improves clarity, reduces ambiguity, and strengthens documentation quality. Follow these rules strictly.

#### 1. Product and Feature Names

- Use official product and feature names exactly as defined.
- Do not invent shorthand versions.
- Do not change capitalization.
- Do not alternate between long and short forms unless formally introduced.

**Correct:**
- Thunder Console  
- Passkey Authentication  

**Incorrect:**
- Thunder console  
- Passkey auth

---

#### 2. Acronyms and Abbreviations

- Define acronyms on first use unless universally known (API, URL, JSON, HTTP).
- After defining an acronym, use it consistently.
- Do not redefine the same acronym within the same document.
- Do not switch between expanded and abbreviated forms randomly.

**Correct:**

> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
> Enable MFA for the application.

**Incorrect:**

> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
> Enable multi-factor authentication for the application.

After defining MFA, use **MFA** consistently.

---

#### 3. Use One Term Per Concept

- Choose one term for each concept and use it consistently.
- Do not switch terminology mid-document.
- Avoid using synonyms interchangeably.

**Incorrect examples:**
- application / app  
- organization / tenant  
- sign in / login (unless intentionally differentiated)

---

#### 4. Avoid Ambiguous Pronouns

Avoid using “it,” “this,” “that,” or “they” when the referent is unclear.

**Ambiguous:**

> Configure the server and restart it.

**Clear:**

> Configure the server and restart the server.

When clarity matters, repeat the noun.

---

#### 5. Prefer Strong Verbs Over Weak “Be” Verbs

Reduce unnecessary use of:
- am  
- is  
- are  
- was  
- were  

Prefer direct, active verbs.

**Instead of:**

> The configuration is located in `deployment.toml`.

**Write:**

> The configuration file is `deployment.toml`.  
> Or:  
> Find the configuration in `deployment.toml`.

**Instead of:**

> The token is used to authenticate requests.

**Write:**

> The token authenticates requests.

Use “is” only when it improves clarity.

---

#### 6. Use Concrete Language

- Prefer precise nouns and strong verbs.
- Avoid vague verbs such as:
  - handle  
  - manage  
  - deal with  
  - perform  
  - utilize  

**Instead of:**

> The system handles authentication.

**Write:**

> The system validates credentials and issues tokens.

---

#### 7. Avoid Informal Abbreviations in Prose

Do not use informal shorthand in documentation text.

**Avoid → Use Instead**

- config → configuration  
- dev → development  
- prod → production  
- env → environment  
- repo → repository  

These abbreviations are allowed only inside:
- Code blocks  
- File paths  
- Commands  
- Environment variable names  

---

## Formatting Rules

### Headings

- Use **Title Case** for all headings (e.g., `# Configure Passwordless Authentication`).
- Make headings task-focused and descriptive.

### Lists

- Use **numbered lists** for procedures.
- Use **bulleted lists** for non-sequential information.
- Keep list items parallel in grammar and structure.

### Text Formatting

- **Bold**: UI labels, buttons, menu items (e.g., Select **Save**).
- `Backticks`: Code elements, file names, paths, commands, URLs (e.g., Update `deployment.toml`).
- Use descriptive link text (e.g., `[Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)`).

### Code Blocks

- Use fenced code blocks with language tags (e.g., ```toml).
- Keep code blocks focused and free of sensitive data.

---

## Document Structure

Documentation must follow a logical structure that guides the reader through the task from start to finish. A well-structured document enables the reader to quickly understand:

- What they will achieve

- When the task is applicable

- What prerequisites are required

- How to complete the task

- How to confirm the outcome

- How to troubleshoot common issues

- Next steps or related tasks

Each section should build on the previous one and move the reader toward successful completion of the task. Avoid unnecessary background information, repetition, or unrelated details that interrupt the flow.

---

## Content Generation Guidelines (AI-Assisted Writing)

When generating content using AI tools, adhere to the following guidelines to ensure quality and compliance with Thunder documentation standards.

### Mandatory Requirements

- AI-generated content must comply with the standards defined in `AGENTS.md`.
- Do not override or reinterpret style rules.
- Ensure the document structure matches the required template when applicable.
- Apply heading capitalization, list formatting, and text formatting rules exactly as specified.

### Accuracy and Validation

- Verify all technical details against the actual product behavior.
- Do not publish AI-generated steps without confirming they work.
- Validate configuration examples before including them.
- Remove any assumptions, guesses, or speculative content.

---

## Quality Checklist

### Before Finalizing

Ensure the document adheres to all style and formatting rules:

- Headings follow capitalization rules.
- Procedures use numbered lists.
- UI labels are **bold**.
- Code elements and paths are in `backticks`.
- Links use descriptive text.
- Content is concise, active voice, present tense.
- No unverified claims or placeholders remain.
- No secrets or sensitive data appear in examples.

### Before Publishing

Review the document and confirm that a reader can:

- Understand the goal within the first section.

- Identify whether the guide applies to their situation.

- Gather all required prerequisites.

- Follow clear, sequential steps.

- Validate that the configuration or action worked as expected.

If any of these elements are missing or unclear, revise the structure before publishing.

---

## Vale Compliance

Before requesting a review, run [Vale](https://vale.sh/) against the document and ensure there are no errors or warnings.

### Requirements

- Address all Vale errors.
- Address all Vale warnings.
- Do not suppress rules unless there is a clear, documented justification.
- If Vale flags a valid product or industry term, add it to the project vocabulary (`.vale/styles/config/vocabularies/vocab/accept.txt`) in the same pull request.
- Re-run Vale after making changes to confirm the document is clean.

Documentation must pass Vale checks before merging.

By adhering to this style guide, you contribute to creating high-quality, user-friendly documentation for Thunder.
