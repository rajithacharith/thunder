# Development Pipeline

## Prerequisites

Before working with the documentation, ensure you have the required development tools installed and configured.

**See**: [Prerequisites - Development Tools](/thunder/docs/community/contributing/contributing-code/prerequisites#development-tools) for complete setup instructions.

## Building Documentation

The documentation can be built independently from the frontend applications.
From the project root, run the following command:

```bash
make build_docs
```

This command:
1. Builds frontend packages (required dependencies)
2. Generates API specifications from OpenAPI files
3. Builds the Docusaurus site

**Output**: Built documentation in `docs/build/`

## Development Server

Start the documentation development server with live reload:

```bash
cd docs
pnpm dev
```

The documentation will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**Features during development:**
- **Hot Reload**: Changes appear instantly without refresh
- **Fast Feedback**: See your edits in real-time
- **Error Reporting**: Clear error messages for invalid MDX
