# Configure and Run

## Configure the Server

Open `backend/cmd/server/repository/conf/deployment.yaml` in your favorite text editor and make the following changes:

**Add CORS allowed origins:**

```yaml
cors:
  allowed_origins:
    - "https://localhost:5190"
    - "https://localhost:5191"
```

:::tip
This configuration allows the Thunder Gate and Thunder Develop applications to communicate with the backend server during development.
:::

**Configure the Gate client:**

```yaml
gate_client:
  port: 5190
```

:::tip
This configuration points the backend server to the local Thunder Gate application for authentication.
:::

## Run the Server

Start the Thunder server & apps in development mode.

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock lang="bash" label="Linux/macOS">
    make run
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock lang="powershell" label="Windows">
    .\build.ps1 run
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

:::note
This command will automatically set up your complete development environment:

**What gets created:**

- `Develop` application with redirect URI pointing to the local Thunder Develop application
- Default admin user with credentials: `admin` / `admin`

**Services that start:**

- **Backend server**: [https://localhost:8090](https://localhost:8090)
- **Thunder Gate** (Login/Register): [https://localhost:5190/gate](https://localhost:5190/gate)
- **Thunder Develop** (Admin Console): [https://localhost:5191/develop](https://localhost:5191/develop)
:::

💡 **Alternatively**, if you would rather run the backend and frontend servers separately, run the following commands in separate terminal windows:

**Backend Server:**

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock lang="bash" label="Linux/macOS">
    make run_backend
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock lang="powershell" label="Windows">
    .\build.ps1 run_backend
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

**Frontend Server:**

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock lang="bash" label="Linux/macOS">
    make run_frontend
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock lang="powershell" label="Windows">
    .\build.ps1 run_frontend
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>
