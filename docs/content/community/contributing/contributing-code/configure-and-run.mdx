# Configure and Run

## Configure the Server

Open `backend/cmd/server/repository/conf/deployment.yaml` in your favorite text editor and make the following changes:

**Add CORS allowed origins:**

```yaml
cors:
  allowed_origins:
    - "https://localhost:5190"
    - "https://localhost:5191"
```

> [!TIP]
> This configuration allows the Thunder Gate and Thunder Develop applications to communicate with the backend server during development.

**Configure the Gate client:**

```yaml
gate_client:
  port: 5190
```

> [!TIP]
> This configuration points the backend server to the local Thunder Gate application for authentication.

## Run the Server

Start the Thunder server & apps in development mode.

```bash
make run
```

> [!Note]
> This command will automatically set up your complete development environment:
>
> **What gets created:**
>
> - `Develop` application with redirect URI pointing to the local Thunder Develop application
> - Default admin user with credentials: `admin` / `admin`
>
> **Services that start:**
>
> - **Backend server**: [https://localhost:8090](https://localhost:8090)
> - **Thunder Gate** (Login/Register): [https://localhost:5190/gate](https://localhost:5190/gate)
> - **Thunder Develop** (Admin Console): [https://localhost:5191/develop](https://localhost:5191/develop)

💡 **Alternatively**, if you would rather run the backend and frontend servers separately, run the following commands in separate terminal windows:

**Backend Server:**

```bash
make run_backend
```

**Frontend Server:**

```bash
make run_frontend
```
